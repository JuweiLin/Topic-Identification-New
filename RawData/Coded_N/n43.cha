%spa:	$PINEW
*PAR:	but <we are> [//] things are gettin(g) pretty hectic because they
	went through and I think everybody's in a panic (be)cause they did
	the pay cut and <all the people that are involved in the exempt or
	the incentive program and I think &-um> [//] number one , the people
	that are involved in the incentive program are all pretty shook up
	(be)cause they took a twenty percent cut . 148206_164669
%spa:	$PINEW
*PAR:	and I think it's trickling down to the rest of the people (be)cause
	they're kinda wondering when it's gonna hit them also . 164669_170056
%spa:	$PINEW
*INV:	so ‡ everybody that was on the incentive takes a twenty percent cut
	? 170056_174410

%spa:	$IPSAME
*PAR:	&=chuckles okay . 177693_178134
%spa:	$BACK
*PAR:	is takin(g) a twenty percent cut between now and September
	depending on the census . 178134_182661
%spa:	$PISAME
*PAR:	&-um the census stays below fifty eight , everybody is taking a
	twenty percent pay cut . 182661_187196
%spa:	$PISAME
*PAR:	if it gets up between fifty eight and sixty eight percent or sixty
	eight for the census &-um <people are gonna> [//] the incentive

%spa:	$PISAME
*INV:	mhm . 196333_196472
%spa:	$BACK
*PAR:	and if it gets above sixty eight , the cut isn't there . 196472_199282
%spa:	$PISAME
*PAR:	&-um if between xxx turn a profit for those two months , pay cut
	will be &-uh reimbursed back to all the incentive people . 199282_211112
%spa:	$PISAME
*PAR:	<and then &-um> [//] also included in the incentive bonus , if the
	hospital makes a profit for the entire year , the people will
	at_least get the incentive bonus even if we lose money over the last
	[!] two months . 211112_222676
%spa:	$PISAME
*INV:	so ‡ the way it looks right now , &-um the worst scenario could be
	a twenty percent cut and no incentive . 222676_230118
%spa:	$IPSAME
*PAR:	right right &-um yeah ‡ like I said , it's like that [/] that's the
	worst scenario . 230118_234738
%spa:	$PISAME
*PAR:	I'm not so sure I see it because at_least with three months
	remaining , the hospital had a eight hundred thousand dollar surplus
	and even_though for the month of July the census is down the toilet
	, &-um eight hundred thousand dollars is a pretty big chunk to lose
	over the last three months &*INV:yeah especially now with [//]
	you_know with &-um all the big incentives obviously that everybody
	hasta get as many patients in here and to xxx and all that kind of
	good stuff . 234738_259408

	patients now . 267547_273213
%spa:	$INEW
*PAR:	yeah ‡ &+w I [/] I think that's one of the [/] &+h this hospital's

%spa:	$PISAME
*PAR:	I think today the census is at fifty four so that would shoot it up
	to seventy which I believe is what they're considering the break
	even point for the hospital that if we have seventy in+patients
	you_know that we should be about break even . 344744_355691
%spa:	$PISAME
